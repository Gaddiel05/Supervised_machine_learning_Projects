# 🤖 Supervised Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains supervised machine learning projects completed as part of the **"Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass"** on **Udemy**, organized by **Pierian Training**.

## 📚 Course Overview

These projects focus on building and evaluating predictive models using various supervised learning algorithms. Each notebook includes hands-on implementation of essential concepts like:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning

> 💡 These projects were completed to reinforce my understanding of supervised learning techniques through practical application.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder or notebook includes:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and testing
- Performance evaluation and visualization

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
